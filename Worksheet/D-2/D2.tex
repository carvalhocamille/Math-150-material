\chead{\textbf{Discussion 2}}

\begin{document}

The goals of this discussion section are: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Get familiar with non-dimensionalizing
\item Acquire some sense of scales to use in a model
\item Create simple models (students should be creative !)
\end{enumerate}

Participation in discussion section counts as 5\% of the grade. Completion of the worksheets counts as 20\% of the grade. \textbf{Submit your worksheet work by February 3rd at 2:59pm.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the product $\pi  = R^\alpha E^\beta t^\gamma \rho^\delta$, where $R$ is the radius of a bomb, $E$ the energy of the bomb, $t$ denotes the time, and $\rho$ the density of the bomb. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Find $\alpha. \beta, \gamma , \delta$ so that $\pi$ has no dimension.
\item Discuss how this quantity can help you deduce information about a system related to bombs detonation.
\end{itemize}

\item Consider the system of differential equations below, with $\beta > 0$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &=& \alpha \ x (M - \beta x -  \gamma y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &=& \alpha \ (y^2+1) (M - \epsilon x)
\end{eqnarray*}
Use changes of variables, for $x$, $y$, and $t$ and rename parameters to simplify the system so that only two parameters are required to describe its behavior. 
\item Work on the exercises 2.1, 2.2, from the typed notes \texttt{Math150\_Chapter2.pdf}
\item Submit your work on Catcourses under the assignment \texttt{Worksheet 2} \textbf{as a .pdf}.
\end{enumerate}
