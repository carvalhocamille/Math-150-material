\chead{\textbf{Discussion 7: March 3rd}}
\begin{document}
The goals of this discussion section are: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item connect random walkers with PDEs describing the global motion.
\end{enumerate}

Participation in discussion section counts as 5\% of the grade. Completion of the worksheets counts as 20\% of the grade. \textbf{Submit your worksheet work by March 10th at 2:59pm.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the governing equation, and its parameter, describing the expectation of the number of walkers moving in a two dimensional plane, at location $(x,y)$ at time $t$ if every time step $\Delta t$ the walkers follow the following rule:\\
	-- Take a step left of length $\Delta x $ with probability 1/6 \\
	-- Take a step right of length $\Delta x $ with probability 1/6 \\
	-- Take a step down of length $ \Delta y$ with probability 1/3 \\
	-- Take a step up of length $ \Delta y$ with probability 1/3 \\
You may introduce some coefficients along the way.
\item Submit your work on Catcourses under the assignment \texttt{Worksheet 7} \textbf{as a .pdf}. 
\end{enumerate}
